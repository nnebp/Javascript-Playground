DATABASE:
	if there is time: remove dups so keys can be set up (that way you cant
	insert a role for a movie that you do not have)

APP:
	setup hello world
	test db connections
	create and test routes
	create/test unit tests

APP design ideas:
	controler (view?) models
	models: movie, role, (actor?)
		idempotent adding of movies and roles?
	helpers: any model code that is used more than once
